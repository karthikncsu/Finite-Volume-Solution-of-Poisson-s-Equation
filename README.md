# Finite Volume Solution of Poisson's Equation


In this gitrepo, Poisson's Equation is solved numerically using combination of spatial discretization techniques like 'thin layer' method, tangent / normal gradient decomposition method and integration methods like Point Jacobi(PJ), Incomplete LU Decomposition(ILU).
